# Foundations of Vision

I have the material for the original version of Foundations of Vision here in this branch fov1995.

I am editing and adding new material in branch V2. 

My intention at this moment is to build the book using [Jupyter books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).  However, I have just seen that there is no wysiwyg editor for that tool.  So, I am rethinking my options.

I am also planning to start a second book, Foundations of Image Systems Engineering (FISE), in a separate repository. That book will focus on the material Joyce Farrell and I teach in Image Systems Engineering (Psych 221).
