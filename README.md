# Foundations of Vision

I plan to host the original version of Foundations of Vision here in the branch fov1995.

I will start to edit and add material for this edition in the main branch. 

My intention at this moment is to build the book using [Jupyter books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).

I am also planning to start a second book, Foundations of Image Systems Engineering (FISE), in a separate repository. That book will focus on the material Joyce Farrell and I teach in Image Systems Engineering (Psych 221).
